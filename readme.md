## Description:
A lightweight operating "layer" built atop POSIX-compliant Linux, 
specifically designed for those who value the elegant simplicity 
and clarity found in operating systems of the 1980s. Optimized for 
maximum focus and efficiency on basic primitives of computing, 
such as file manipulation, text editing, command-line interactions, 
and efficient resource management.
