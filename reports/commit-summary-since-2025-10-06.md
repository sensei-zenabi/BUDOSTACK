# Post-October 6 Engineering Notes

I spent this stretch tightening the launcher and shell loop. Ctrl+C no longer leaves stray state, palette scaling is numerically stable, and row syncing stays deterministic so the renderer stops jittering. Account setup is now hands-off: missing homes are detected and provisioned as soon as credentials check out.

On the automation front I made runtask path-agnostic, broadened argument parsing, and wired the TASK compiler to stitch binaries without supervision. `_CALC` gives script authors inline arithmetic, and I dropped in a calibration scenario for quick color checks.

I also shipped a D&D dice roller, a dungeon-planning stub, and a playful Tic-Tac-Toe. Fresh screenshots plus refined palettes keep the new assets looking crisp.
