# Script Name: install-apps.sh
# Description: Template for installing applications using sudo and a package
#              manager. This script prompts the user once at the beginning to 
#              confirm proceeding, and then sequentially installs the listed 
#              programs.
#
# Design Principles:
# - User Prompt: Only one prompt for user confirmation before any changes.
# - Modularization: Each installation step is encapsulated in its own function.
# - Extendability: New packages/programs can be added by creating additional
#                  functions or adding entries to the packages list.
# - Portability: Uses plain Bash and standard utilities (assumes apt as package
#                manager; change the package manager command if needed).
#
# Usage: 
#   chmod +x install-apps.sh
#   ./install-apps.sh
#
# Requirements:
#   - The script must be run on a system with sudo privileges.
#   - Modify PACKAGE_MANAGER if you use a different package manager (e.g. yum, pacman).
# =============================================================================

# Set the package manager command (modify if needed, e.g., "yum install -y")
PACKAGE_MANAGER="apt-get install -y"

# Array of packages to install. Extend this list as needed.
