BUDOSTACK has entered "hardening" phase. This means that no major 
new capabilities will be introduced, and the focus is making the 
existing ones, such as TASK scripting, as robust and capable.

During the hardening phase it is possible, that some of the already
existing in-built capabilities will be deprecated to enable more
focused user experience in the final product.
